Project Number3
	
Files: Main.java and LazyBinarySearchTree.java

Compile Information: 
	IDE: Eclipse for Java Developers
	Java Version: 1.8.0_201
	
Other: I used the command prompt to test and debug 
		my program and had both my input and output
		files saves in the src folder with the java
		files. The following are the commands
		that I used to run my program.
	Sample commands:
		javac Main.java LazyBinarySearchTree.java
		java Main Input.txt output.txt
		
	The is a chance that findMax and findMin do not
	work the way that they should. I had many problems
	with my findMax method because it will only output
	what max is initialized. The same can be said about
	findMin.
